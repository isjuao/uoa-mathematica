# UoA Mathematica coursework

A Mathematica notebook containing my work for the final
[data science course](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/registry/courses/course/CS551L/2023) project.

Within this project, I analysed geospatial data on the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the G7 countries. My 
focus was on a differential analysis of confirmed case numbers for the most populous states of the United States, 
including non-linear modeling and time series analysis.
